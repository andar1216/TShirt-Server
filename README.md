🚦 Order of Development
1. Backend Stability (now → 1 week)

Make sure your EC2 backend is fully production-ready:

Dockerized Node/Express (already partly done).

CORS simplified (since you’re unified under sattire.store).

Postgres (either RDS or local container) wired in and tested.

Logging + error handling (so Stripe, Printful, and other integrations give clean errors).

🔹 Deliverable: A stable backend you can trust to always return /api/config, /api/stripe/..., /api/printful, etc.

2. Shopping Cart & Checkout Flow (1–2 weeks)

Frontend (React/Vite):

Add cart state (context or Redux).

Cart page (items, qty, subtotal).

Checkout page → Stripe PaymentIntent integration.

Backend:

Stripe webhook endpoint (to confirm successful payments).

Save orders in DB (so you can see them later).

Integration:

Hook Stripe → Printful API (so when someone checks out, the order auto-creates in Printful).

🔹 Deliverable: Full working e-commerce flow: “Add to cart → Checkout → Stripe → Printful.”

3. User Profiles / Accounts (2–3 weeks)

Database: Enable the Postgres connection again (users table).

Backend:

Auth routes (/api/register, /api/login, /api/logout).

JWT-based sessions (so users stay logged in).

Frontend:

Registration page (name, email, password).

Login page.

Profile page (order history, saved designs, etc.).

Security:

Passwords hashed (bcrypt).

Sessions protected with HTTPS (already covered with ACM).

🔹 Deliverable: Users can create accounts, log in, and see their order history.

4. Scaling / Polish (ongoing after 1–2 months)

CI/CD fully automated (GitHub Actions → EC2 + CloudFront invalidations).

Database migration scripts (Prisma, Sequelize, or raw SQL).

Metrics (CloudWatch logs, Stripe dashboard, Printful logs).

Future: recommendation system, AR try-on, etc.

⏳ Estimated Timeline

Week 1 → Backend stability + database connected.

Weeks 2–3 → Cart + checkout fully functional.

Weeks 4–6 → User authentication + profile system.

After Week 6 → Scaling, polish, extras.

If you dedicate ~2–3 hours a day, you could have a working store with checkout in ~3 weeks, and a full user system in ~6 weeks.

⚡ Question for you:
Do you want me to start by wiring your Postgres DB back in (step 1) so your backend can support users/orders? Or should we jump straight into the shopping cart flow with Stripe + Printful since that’s more customer-facing?
